Qtts is a command-line utility for converting text to speech.

Here's how to get started:

. Make sure you have the following tools installed:

.. Bash version 5.2.21 or later.
You can check this by running `bash --version`.

.. Docker version 28.2.2 or later.
You can check this by running `docker --version`.

.. SoX version 14.4.2 or later.
You can check this by running `sox --version`.

. link:{x_download_url}[Download] the `qtts` script.
You can put the script anywhere you like, but the rest of these steps
will assume that you've put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

. Run `qtts "The source of the huge river is the clear spring."` to
generate and play the resulting speech through your sound card.
